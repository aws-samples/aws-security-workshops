Welcome to the AWS security workshops portal! Here you will find a collection of workshops and other hands-on content aimed at helping you gain an understanding of the AWS service ecosystem and introduce you to a variety of best practices that can be applied to securing your environments and workloads running in AWS. Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure which runs all of the services offered and this responsibility is known as the Security of the Cloud . AWS customers benefit from a data center and network architecture built to satisfy the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Customers responsibility, known as the Security in the Cloud , is determined by which services the customer chooses to use. The workshops and other hands-on content contained in this portal are focused on the Security in the Cloud and they will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks you'll face in building securely on AWS.

The scenario simulates an attack that spans a few threat vectors, representing just a small sample of the threats that GuardDuty is able to detect. In addition, you will look at how to view and analyze GuardDuty findings, how to send alerts based on the findings, and, finally, how to remediate findings.

This feature addresses a longstanding customer issue, namely, how do I delegate administration to my users. If you have developers that need to be able to create roles for Lambda functions, system administrators that need to be able to create IAM roles and users, or any similar scenario, then you need permission boundaries. Level : Intermediate Duration : 1 hour Services : AWS IAM Permission Boundaries Focus : Delegated Administration Using AWS Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS and AWS Fargate This Secrets Manager Builder Session guides you through the use of AWS Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS and AWS Fargate. In the first phase of the Builder Session, you will access the RDS data base with Secrets Manager. You will then use Secrets Manager to rotate the data base password. You will then use Secrets Manager to access the data base again to show that you can continue to access the data base after the rotation. In the second phase of the Builder Session, you will extend your use of Secrets Manager into an AWS Fargate container. You will create an Amazon ECS task definition to pass secrets to the Fargate container and then launch the Fargate container. You will then SSH into the container to show that the secret was passed to the container and that you can access the RDS data base.

Build a Vulnerability Management Program Using AWS for AWS In this workshop we start by guiding you through tagging your resources and maintaining an asset inventory for visibility and governance purposes with AWS Tags and Systems Manager (SSM). We then build an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) baking pipeline, harden the AMI with AWS SSM and install the Amazon Inspector agent. Within the pipeline we look for vulnerabilities and apply patches before promoting the AMI for use by an application. Next we construct a continuous detection framework to detect change in state of security or detection of vulnerabilities using Amazon Inspector and AWS SSM\u2019s Patch Manager. Finally we put all these pieces together to manage your Amazon EC2 fleet at scale. Level : 300 Duration : 2 hours NIST CSF Functions : Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover CAF Components : Detective, Responsive Personas : Security analysts and Security operations engineers Finding and addressing Network Misconfigurations on AWS In this workshop you will learn how to use the Amazon Inspector Network Reachability report to validate your network configuration without needing a deep background in networking. You will use this report to find misconfigurations that may result in unintended behaviors and unexpected vulnerabilities. You will finish the workshop by remediating these vulnerabilities by integrating the findings of Amazon Inspector with other AWS services.
